ALGORITHMS: Sorting & Searching.

Sorting algorithms:

Bubble sort - Complexity O(n^2), we iterate the array and every time
arr[i] > arr[i+1] we swap them, if we made a full iteration without swaping
the array is sorted and we break the loop.

Insertion sort - Complexity O(n^2), we consider the beginning of the array
as the sorted part, we iterate through the unsorted part, if arr[i] > arr[i-1]
arr[i] is now in the sorted part, if it's not we check the new member with 
each member before it until we find the right place and then insert it.
after we find the member's place we continue with the iteration. 
when arr[n-1] is greater then arr[n-2] the array is sorted.

Selection sort - we search for the smaller member of the array and swap it with
the first member of the unsorted array, after each swap we move the "first unsorted"
one place forward so that each member before it is in the sorted part of the 
array. We finish when the "first unsorted" points to arr[n-1].

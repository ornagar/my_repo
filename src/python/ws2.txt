1. What are mutable or immutable objects?
	mutable objects are objects that their memory is accessible to 
	changes, like lists, dictionaries. immutable: primitives, strings, 
	tuplets.
	
2. What is an exception? Why is it needed?
	An exception occours when an unexpected or unwanted behavior happens
	in the program, it's ment to stop the normal execution and find the 
	part of the program that is willing to handle the exception. if not 
	caught in an "try" block the excecution ends sending the type 
	of exception to stderr. The exceptions are a very powerfull tool 
	that throws an acknowledgment that can be caught in any level of calling functions.

3. What will the following program print? Why?
	4
	3
	n = 3 -> is a global object and n = 4 is local to foo, so print inside foo will print its 
	local n and the last print happens in the global scope so it will print the only n he knows.

4. What will the following program print? Why
	[4]
	[4]
	lists are passed by reference so the assignment on n[0] go to the object pointed by n 
	in both scopes and changes it.
